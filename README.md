# Class-Date
This Java program implements a date management system that allows users to input, validate, and manipulate dates. The Date class defines a date with day, month, and year attributes and includes methods for validating dates, calculating the difference between two dates, determining the day of the week, and printing the date in a readable format. The class also implements the Comparable interface, enabling sorting by date. The Main class provides a menu-driven interface where users can add dates, check the day of the week for a specific date, calculate the difference between two dates, and display all stored dates in sorted order. The program ensures correct date validation, including leap year handling. It uses an ArrayList to store multiple dates and a Scanner for user input. The main loop allows users to repeatedly choose operations until they decide to exit. Input validation ensures that users provide correct date values and select valid indices when accessing stored dates. The program is structured to be simple and efficient while maintaining readability and functionality.
